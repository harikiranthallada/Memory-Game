## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
To begin with it was a fun experience going back to basics. The game was an interesting fun task. I have recalled many concepts.
The main challenge I have faced is getting used to "glich" which is a new interface for me. But it is a fun website too. 
But got to know about it within no time because of its nice UI and file assembly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
As I said It is a very fun task to do. About the questions: I have got many questions about: 
how well we can improve the currect task. 
what are the extensions/ feauture we can add to the task. 
I want to try many more such intersting works that helps me gain knowledge.



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
about the extensions:
**I would love to add some more additional functionalities:**
- adding a function that would shuffle the color boxes
- would like to add buttons with different shapes.
- adding a function that would give a unique pattern in each play.
- would like to add a functionality that fast up the pattern speed in each turn
- adding a function that would calculate score of the player.
- would like to add a mode that gives out pattern with no limit until player makes a mistake.
- adding a functionality that would prompt the best score, player so far achieved.
